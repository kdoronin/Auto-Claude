## Current Focus

**Next Action:** Start Phase 3.2 (Multi-Agent Cross-Validation) or Phase 4.1

**Phase 3 Accomplishments:**
- REQ-003: Confidence threshold routing implemented
- PRReviewFinding model extended with confidence, source_agents, cross_validated fields
- ConfidenceTier class with HIGH (>=0.8), MEDIUM (0.5-0.8), LOW (<0.5) thresholds
- Low-confidence findings logged but excluded from output
- Medium-confidence findings prefixed with "[Potential]"
- Orchestrator prompt updated with confidence tier documentation

**Key files modified in Phase 3:**
- `apps/backend/runners/github/models.py` - PRReviewFinding model fields
- `apps/backend/runners/github/services/parallel_orchestrator_reviewer.py` - ConfidenceTier + routing
- `apps/backend/runners/github/output_validator.py` - Compatibility fix
- `apps/backend/prompts/github/pr_parallel_orchestrator.md` - Documentation

## Decisions Made

1. **Validation on all reviews:** Finding-validator will run on initial reviews, not just follow-ups
2. **Evidence enforcement:** Findings without code evidence will be filtered
3. **Scope filtering:** Findings outside PR scope will be pre-filtered
4. **Phase 3 deferred optimizations:** Confidence routing and multi-agent agreement can wait until core validation works
5. **Prompt placement consistency:** CRITICAL: Full Context Analysis section placed after Review Guidelines in all prompts
6. **Content consistency:** Identical tool usage instructions across all 6 specialist prompts
7. **Integration pattern:** In follow-up prompts, added CRITICAL section as complement to existing NEVER ASSUME sections
8. **finding-validator invoked for ALL findings:** Every finding gets validated, not just high-confidence ones
9. **Dismissed findings removed entirely:** Not flagged, completely excluded from output
10. **validation_evidence required:** Each validated finding must include actual code snippet as proof
11. **Evidence must have code syntax characters:** (=, (), {}, etc.) to pass programmatic validation
12. **Impact findings allowed for unchanged files:** If description contains breaks/affects/depends keywords
13. **AST traversal for Python:** Use ast.walk() instead of NodeVisitor for simpler one-pass traversal
14. **Import filtering:** Only resolve imports to files that exist in project directory
15. **JSON parsing fallback:** Try standard parse first, then comment stripping with quote counting
16. **Path alias first match:** Use first target path when alias has multiple mappings
17. **Use grep for reverse deps:** Grep with -rl flag is fastest cross-platform option
18. **5-second timeout on grep:** Prevents hanging on large repositories
19. **Skip generic names in reverse deps:** index, main, utils, helpers, types, constants skipped to reduce noise
20. **Fix .d.ts detection:** Use name.endswith('.d.ts') instead of path.suffix == '.d.ts'
21. **Default confidence is 0.5:** Medium confidence as baseline when not explicitly set
22. **output_validator treats 0.5 as default:** For backwards compatibility with existing validator logic
23. **Simple class over enum:** ConfidenceTier uses string constants to match codebase style
24. **Routing after validation:** Confidence routing occurs after evidence/scope validation, before verdict

---

## Patterns Established

1. **Tool verification pattern:** Read tool -> verify existence -> provide evidence -> check mitigations
2. **Evidence requirement:** Actual code snippets required, not descriptions
3. **Phase 3.5 validation workflow:** Synthesis -> Validate ALL findings -> Filter dismissed -> Re-calculate verdict
4. **Binary validation status:** confirmed_valid OR dismissed_false_positive OR needs_human_review
5. **Programmatic validation defense-in-depth:** AI validation + programmatic filters
6. **Filter logging:** All filtered findings logged with reasons for debugging
7. **AST pattern:** ast.parse() -> ast.walk() -> isinstance checks for node types
8. **Multi-pattern import detection:** Relative, alias, CommonJS, re-export patterns in sequence
9. **Subprocess with timeout:** subprocess.run(..., timeout=5.0) for external commands
10. **Priority sorting:** Sort within categories, then concatenate for stable ordering
11. **Confidence tier routing:** HIGH (>=0.8) as-is, MEDIUM (0.5-0.8) [Potential] prefix, LOW (<0.5) excluded

## Pending Todos

| File | Title | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| 2026-01-19-cli-path-detection-consolidation.md | Remove redundant backend CLI path detection | urgent (target: 2.7.5) |

---

## Learnings

1. Plan 01-01 included some work from plan 01-02 scope (tool instructions for initial 4 prompts)
2. Task 2 in plan 02-02 was merged into Task 1 (both added methods to same file)
3. Plan 02-01 features were committed with 02-02 labels (execution order mismatch)
4. path.suffix returns only final extension (.ts for .d.ts files) - use endswith() instead
5. Existing code checking `if confidence:` treats 0.5 as truthy - fix by checking `if confidence > 0.5:`
