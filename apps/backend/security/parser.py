"""
Command Parsing Utilities
==========================

Functions for parsing and extracting commands from shell command strings.
Handles compound commands, pipes, subshells, and various shell constructs.

Windows Compatibility Note:
--------------------------
On Windows, commands containing paths with backslashes can cause shlex.split()
to fail (e.g., incomplete commands with unclosed quotes). This module includes
a fallback parser that extracts command names even from malformed commands,
ensuring security validation can still proceed.

    Fallback command extraction when shlex.split() fails.
